disease_info = {
    "Apple_Scab": "Choose resistant varieties when possible.\nRake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.\nWater in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.\nSpread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.\nFor best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.",
    "Apple_Black_rot": "Remove the cankers by pruning at least 15 inches below the end and burn or bury them. Also take preventative care with new season prunings and burn them, too.You are better off pruning during the dormant season. This will minimize the odds that fire blight will infect your tree and produce dead tissue that can easily be infected by Botryosphaeria.You should also take precautions if the bark is damaged by hail, or branches break during a windstorm. Using a copper-based fungicide will protect against both black rot and fire blight.",
    "Apple_Cedar_Apple_Rust": "Choose resistant cultivars when available.\nRake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\nRemove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\nApply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\nOn juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\nSafely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.",
    "Apple_Healthy": "Apples Are Nutritious. \nApples May Be Good for Weight Loss.\nApples May Be Good for Your Heart. \nThey're Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes. \nThey May Have Prebiotic Effects and Promote Good Gut Bacteria.\nSubstances in Apples May Help Prevent Cancer.",
    "Background_without_leaves": "please reupload image with leaf",
    "Blueberry___healthy": "Deep, low pH mulch like peat moss, pine needles or well aged sawdust conserves water and minimizes soil water fluctuations. Water blueberry plants during the day. Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Give them at least 1\" per week during growing season and up to 4\" per week during fruit ripening.The blueberry is a shallow-rooted plant. Therefore, it requires a soil that holds moisture, but also drains well and doesnt stay wet. Dont plant blueberries in sites that have heavy, clayey soils that stay wet.",
    "Cherry___Powdery_mildew": "Disinfect the cutting edges, then prune out and discard the diseased portions of the plant immediately. At the same time, apply fungicides to protect the remaining leaves on the fruit tree. You'll need to repeat the fungicide applications according to label instructions to protect the trees over the entire season.",

    "Corn_Common_rust": "To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance. In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant. If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide.",
    "Corn_Northern_Leaf_Blight": "Fungicide applications reduced Northern Corn Leaf Blight damage and protected yield. Fungicide value was higher in reducing yield in susceptible corn hybrids. Fungicide were most effective if they were applied at disease onset. Disease onset varied in growth stages, and so the best stage to apply fungicides.",
    "Corn_Healthy": "Corn has several health benefits. Because of the high fiber content, it can aid with digestion. It also contains valuable B vitamins, which are important to your overall health. Corn also provides our bodies with essential minerals such as zinc, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese.",
    "Grape___Black_rot": "Mancozeb is available as BONIDE MANCOZEB FLOWABLE fungicide. It contains 37% Mancozeb and should be very effective for controlling black rot. Nova (myclobutanil) is available in IMMUNOX FUNGICIDE. It is 1.55 % myclobutanil and should be effective for controlling black rot.",
    "Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)": "Till date there is no effective method to control this disease. Remove the infected berries, leaves and trunk and destroy them. Protect the prune wounds to minimize fungal infection using wound sealant (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) or essential oil or suitable fungicides.",

    "Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening)": "The only way to prevent the spread of Citrus Greening Disease is to control ACP(Asian Citrus Psyllid). Since citrus is such a popular and widely-planted garden tree, homeowners are on the front lines of this important battle.Spray the lemon tree with Neem oil insecticide, both the top and undersides of the foliage. You may need to repeat in 10-14 days, depending upon the extent of the infestation. Follow up by treating the mold growth with liquid copper fungicide.",
    "Peach___Bacterial_spot": "Fruit symptoms of bacterial spot may be confused with peach scab, caused by the fungus Cladosporium carpophyllium, however scab spots are more circular, have a dark brown/greenish, fuzzy appearance, and do not pit the fruit surface, although skin cracking can occur. Scab does not cause leaf symptoms but can cause spots on twigs. Initial fruit spots of bacterial spot may be superficial but develop into craters.",
    "Peach___healthy": "Packed With Nutrients and Antioxidants. \nMay Aid Digestion. \nMay Improve Heart Health. \nMay Protect Your Skin.\nMay Prevent Certain Types of Cancer.\nMay Reduce Allergy Symptoms.\nWidely Available and Easy to Add to Your Diet.",

Mouthwash. The mouthwash you may use on a daily basis for killing the germs in your mouth can also be effective at killing powdery mildew spores.",
    "Strawberry___Leaf_scorch": "While leaf scorch on strawberry plants can be frustrating, there are some strategies which home gardeners may employ to help prevent its spread in the garden. The primary means of strawberry leaf scorch control should always be prevention. Since this fungal pathogen overwinters on the fallen leaves of infected plants, proper garden sanitation is key. This includes the removal of infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection.",
    "Strawberry___healthy": "The heart-shaped silhouette of the strawberry is the first clue that this fruit is good for you. These potent little packages protect your heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and guard against cancer.\n\nPacked with vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of antioxidants known as polyphenols, strawberries are a sodium-free, fat-free, cholesterol-free, low-calorie food. They are among the top 20 fruits in antioxidant capacity and are a good source of manganese and potassium. Just one serving -- about eight strawberries -- provides more vitamin C than an orange.",
    "Tomato_Bacterial_spot": "Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.  To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.  Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.  Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the product that you select to ensure that you use it in the safest and most effective manner possible.",
    "Tomato_Early_blight": "Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.",
    "Tomato_Late_blight": "Sanitation is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit. Currently, there are no strains of tomato available that are resistant to late tomato blight, so plants should be inspected at least twice a week. Since late blight symptoms are more likely to occur during wet conditions, more care should be taken during those times. For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.",
    "Tomato_Leaf_Mold": "When treating tomato plants with fungicide, be sure to cover all areas of the plant that are above the soil, especially the underside of leaves, where the disease often forms. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available.",
    "Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot'": "Remove diseased leaves. \nImprove air circulation around the plants.\nMulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.\nDo not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.\nControl weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.\nUse crop rotation. Next year do not plant tomatoes back in the same location where diseased tomatoes grew. Wait 12 years before replanting tomatoes in these areas.\nUse fungicidal sprays.",
    "Tomato_Spider_mites": "Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.\nAvoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.\nDo not over-fertilize.\nOverhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.",
    "Tomato_Target_Spot": "Cultural control is important. The following should be done:\nDo not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.\nPlant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).\nCheck all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.\nRemove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base\nRemove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.\nKeep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.\nDo not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.\nCollect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.\nPractise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.",
    "Tomato_Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus": "Use only virus-and whitefly-free tomato and pepper transplants. Transplants should be treated with Capture (bifenthrin) or Venom (dinotefuran) for whitefly adults and Oberon for eggs and nymphs. Imidacloprid or thiamethoxam should be used in transplant houses at least seven days before shipping. Imidacloprid should be sprayed on the entire plant and below the leaves; eggs and flies are often found below the leaves. Spray every 14-21 days and rotate on a monthly basis with Abamectin so that the whiteflies do not build-up resistance to chemicals.",
    "Tomato_Tomato_mosaic_virus": "Use certified disease-free seed or treat your own seed.\nSoak seeds in a 10% solution of trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) for at least 15 minutes.\nOr heat dry seeds to 158 F and hold them at that temperature for two to four days.\nPurchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.\nInspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.\nAvoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.\nWash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants.",
    "Tomato_healthy": "The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a fruit from the nightshade family native to South America.\n\nDespite botanically being a fruit, its generally eaten and prepared like a vegetable.\n\nTomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.\n\nThey are also a great source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K."
